# Processes for self management
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will find in the next chapters the key processes that allow us to work effectively in a self-managed environment. Post a comment if anything is missing!

## Internal communication > absolute transparency
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All employees get access to the "Tiramsiu shared" drive folder that contains ALL information about Tiramsiu, even people's salaries, our finance and performance evaluations. We switched to slack also to provide more transparency than previously existed with emails, since in general anyone can join any slack channel, apart from those made "closed" for a good reason.

Why? Laloux explains it superbly (pp110-111):

"The way information flows illustrates how assumptions (conscious or unconscious) shape organizational practices. In most workplaces, valuable information goes to important people first and then trickles down to the less important.

In Teal organizations, they are no unimportant people. Everybody expects to have access to all the information at the same time. It's a « no secret » approach.

3 reasons make this practice compelling for self-managing organizations:

1.  In the absence of hierarchy, self-managing teams need to have all the information available to make the best decisions.

2.  Any information that isn't public will cause suspicion (why else would someone go through the trouble to keep it secret?) and suspicion is toxic for the organization's trust.

3.  Informal hierarchies emerge when some people are in the know while others not."

Around two years ago we have moved to Slack in order to improve even further our transparency so that everyone has access to all conversation and information at any given time.

**Limits to this near absolute transparency at Tiramsiu:**

-   **Not all volunteers get access to the entire drive**, only employees and a few volunteers.

-   We have a Tiramsiu **confidential drive** with employees personal info (it's a legal requirement to keep this confidential) and some other stuff (accounting, salary sheets... Our salaries policy will be transparent though).

-   We will probably have in the future some group of people requiring a degree of confidentiality (Firing, legal decisions...)

## Decision making > advice process & consent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Tiramsiu we use 2 different decision processes depending on the type of decision:

-   **Consen**t based decision making with the entire team **for big decisions.** « Big » decisions include : wellbeing mixes + the high end of strategic decisions (= from annual objectives/intentions to our values and purpose)

-   **The advice process** for everything else.

PLUS: we have a general policy that **no one can make a decision that goes against our values or purpose.**

Using these processes is **compulsory** and non-negotiable. In case someone does not, you can use our conflict resolution process to deal with it.

**The advice process**

-------------------------------------------------

Here's how Laloux describes the advice process (pp 100-103):

"**In principle, any person in the organization can make any decision**. But before doing so,that person must seek advice from all affected parties and people with expertise on the matter.The person is under no obligation to integrate every piece of advice; the point is not to achieve a watered down compromise to accommodate everyone's wishes. But advice must be sought and taken into serious consideration. The bigger the decision, the wider the net must be cast(...). Usually, the decision maker is the person who notice the issue or opportunity or the person most affected by it."

At Tiramsiu, **the advice process is applied within the scopes of people's roles**. What does that mean? That you can decide how best to enact your roles' purpose and what should be done, taking into account the advice of people who will be affected. It also means that you cannot start projects that answer the purpose of somebody else's role.

**The advice process is a key process to making self management function**: it is actually so critical that in some self managing organizations, colleagues know that forgetting to uphold the advice process is one of the few things that can get them fired.

There are **many benefits of the advice process > it creates:**

-   Community, as people whose advice is sought feel honored and needed

-   Humility, through the act of asking for advice and recognizing the need for others

-   Learning, on the job with real cases and people who are experts and care

-   Better decisions, since decision maker is close to the issue and will have to live with the consequences of the decision (unlike top managers in traditional hierarchies)

-   Fun and creativity

"With the advice process, the ownership of the decision stays clearly with one person: the decision maker. Convinced she has made the best possible decision, she sees things through with great enthusiasm, trying to prove to advice givers that their trust was well placed or their objections immaterial. While consensus drains energy out of an organization, the advice process boosts motivation and initiative."

You can ask for advice on slack, or during the different periodic or ad-hoc meetings, or by asking for a meeting with a specific person.

Consent decision making
-------------------------------------------------------

**Here are the steps:**

1.  **Presentation** of the topic and proposal by the initiator (good preparation is key!)

2.  **Discussion**: Some sort of facilitated discussion (brainstorming, love it/change it/leave it feedback, simple round of reactions, etc.), during which modifications to improve the proposal are made. The notetaker ensures accurate recordings are made.

3.  **Additions to proposal**: The facilitator reads the modified proposal and asks if this corresponds to the group's ideas or if there are still additions to be made.

4.  **Decision on proposal:** The facilitator states the (updated) proposal and asking "Can you live with it?"

    1.  ***Thumbs up*** from everyone means ***yes I can live with it!***

    2.  ***Thumb down*** is a ***blocking***, means the person has a grave concern that either there was a breach in process or the proposal goes against our values/purpose and the proposal is rejected or should be discussed.

    3.  ***Thumb to the side***  *_means*  **I have a concern that is not a blocking**_, so it does not block approval.

    4.  ***No thumb*** means ***I abstain***, which can happen for various reasons (for eg: I don't feel concerned by this decision and don't want to vote on it, I arrive too late in the process to make an informed decision but trust the group to make the right decision...)

Lately we have also been experimenting with consent from sociocracy3.0 (see poster below also available open source from their website); very similar to the above but with different gestures.

1.  **Thumbs up** from everyone means they don't object to the proposal

2.  **Hand facing the sky** as if we were offering a present when we want to "give" an objection to improve the proposal

3.  **Hand facing down** and shaking when we have a "concern" that we want to express but we have no objection

## What about the money? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Financial processes**

### Financial circle

**There should a financial circle composed by the lead of all the other circles and who would be responsible for the budget.** Together with the person holding the role of financial management,

Rest of the details to be completed (we still have no money to spend :( )

Role definition and allocation[](#role-definition-and-allocation)

As explained, at Tiramsiu we have roles instead of fixed job descriptions and we use [glassfrog](https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/23039/orgnav/roles/12945438) instead of a regular organigram and job descriptions.

## Role definition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**In general**, the lead link of each circle holds its purpose is responsible for ensuring that the appropriate roles exist for the purpose to be realized and that there is a good fit between the roles and the people. In pratice, these discussions and any decisions are generally held with all (or most of) the circle members, during governance meetings.

How are roles allocated?[](#how-are-roles-allocated)

--------------------------------------------------------

Well, normally when you applied for a position at Tiramsiu, the roles you would be responsible for were clearly described and this is how you obtained your first roles.

After, your roles may evolve as new needs arise and roles appear, or if you want to evolve professionnally. The spaces to discuss how you would like to evolve your roles at Tiramsiuare the 1:1 or annual evaluation or informally with your team mates, and the place to decide/officialise role reallocations are governance meetings.

In practice, quite a few role allocations and changes happen informally, in discussion with the lead links.

How are roles defined?[](#how-are-roles-defined)

----------------------------------------------------

Each lead link is responsible for making sure the roles are clearly defined. He/she can decide how the role definition happens and who does it. Subsequent changes to the role definitions are generally made or decided during governance meetings.

## Conflict resolution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conflict is a normal part of any long term relation between humans**. What's important is to have the courage to address it, with an attitude and skills that will support the relationship, not endanger it. So if you are in a conflict with someone: congratulations!!! You are a normal human being and about to live an experience that will help you grow :-)

Here we will define processes and framework for non-violent and efficient conflict resolution (To be completed)


## Potential dismissal process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When hiring someone new to join our team, it's important to be aware that our working culture is not a good match to everyone. Approximately once a year since Tiramsiu started having employees, someone has been dismissed. Because of our human centered culture and the fact that the people we work with are not only colllegues but also friends, the longer the person has been part of the team, the more difficult it is to go through a dismissal process (believe it, we know from experience!!).

From this experience comes the first and most important principle: ***"hire fast, fire fast!".*** The objective is to NEVER AGAIN have to fire someone that has been in the team beyond their trial period.

Key principles for *hire fast fire fast* to function well[](#key-principles-for-hire-fast-fire-fast-to-function-well)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Don't talk about people behind their back!

-   Each circle takes the lead on deciding who to hire and integrate, using the advice process.

-   The newbie has an integration coach to support his/her integration. Whoever is an integration coach should have been at Tiramsiu for 6-12 months.

-   An integration team is formed with the 3 people who will work most with the newbie. The integration team should ideally be present for entire integration period (at least! or even 6-12 months longer).

-   The decision whether the new person can stay beyond the integration period or not is taken within the integration team based upon peer evaluation.

-   The process transparent to the person hired from day 1. Clearly say to the newbie that we *hire fast and fire fast*.

-   Talent development role is present to ensure the process is respected and as support to the integration team upon request (tools explanations, mediation, advice...).

-   All evaluations in trial period and any other important communication/meeting is done in written form.

-   Past experience has shown us that is the person is underperforming in the following areas in the first 1-3 months, then the person will not do well at Tiramsiu in the long term: leadership, goal oriented working attitude and (to a certain extent) following internal Tiramsiu rules. **Take these indicators seriously!!!**
