--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter explains the different collaboration tools the Community Heroes team works with:
- What each tool is for
- Tutorials /Information on how to use them
- How to get access

## Intro
Yes we know that too many tools can be confusing and we would like to find the **One tool to Rule them all**, but we didn't.
And for an international team (even a small one), it's important to have the right tools to collaborate, share documents, discuss, schedule... 

## Slack
All the internal discussions happen there

## Trello
Management of tasks and discussions directly related to these tasks. Each circle has its own trello board.

## Google Meet
for remote meetings

## Google Drive
for File Storage & Working on files

## Google Calendar
for scheduling meetings & having our agendas accessible for others (a shared calendar is also integrated with Slack)

## Glassfrog
Holacracy software allowing to define the circles and roles and show them in a visual overview

## Mural
Whiteboard for online workshops
