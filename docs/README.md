# Community Heroes Guidebook
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### A guidebook to help all team members understand Community Heroes mission, values and way of work

Hey there!

If you're reading this, it means that either you're part of the Community Heroes team or you're lost and found this page by mistake. In the first case, reading it is mandatory... in the second, it's optional of course :) 

**Why this Guidebook?**

Well first, it's because Community Heroes is a very new and young company... so new that it's not incorporated yet (this part needs to be updated ASAP :D) and we are all striving to build a team and culture where everyone will feel included and has value to add.

We are also trying to build a culture that is purpose-driven and encouraging wholeness. This might be intimidating or difficult to grasp for many of us, especially those coming from large companies with multi-layers of management... 

So this Guidebook is as useful to founding team as it is to all the newcomers and will hopefully allow to explain what's our culture, how do we work and how any of use could participate in evolving the company and the project.
