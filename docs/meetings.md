# Community Heroes meetings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some people love meetings and some hate them... we love meaningful meetings and hate the *could have been an email* ones.
Community Heroes is still young and we are still figuring our the best organization and the best meeting system but here are the ones that we already defined.

## Weekly operational meetings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every monday at 16:00 CET (the invite will be in the shared calendar)
We discuss about the achievement of last week and define the priorities of the next one. 

## Bi-Monthly product meetings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every 2 weeks the whole team is discussing about the product. The product manager is presenting the development progress and discussing the next features and ideas.

## Daily product standup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Development team only. Discuss the work done yesterday, the work to be done today and any issue met.

## Monthly priorization meeting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every start of the month, we set back and review what we achieved the last month and set the priorities of the upcoming one



**NB: This might change regularly and soon as we are still trying to find the best way to do it with the actual team. We are also thinking about implementing the holacracy meetings (Tactical, governance) but it's not confirmed yet.**
