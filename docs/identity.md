## Mission and values

**Tiramisu aims to** Create an environment of community and purpose. We strongly believe that open and inclusive communities can engage people and organizations in meaningful, diverse and fun connections and help them become better versions of themselves.

**Tiramisu's values** are like its DNA, an intrinsic and stable part of its identity. They are not just company's values statement that we stick on our walls (we don't have walls btw), they also define the behaviours and the skills that every team member needs to care about. If you have joined the Tiramisu team , then you must agree with these values since we used them as a evaluation criteria to onboard you ;). Read, reread and rereread them. They are key. You will find them in our meeting check-ins, in our debriefings, as a tool to make decisions and transformed into competencies you need to have in your integration evaluation.

-   **Respect** : Respecting others means to listen to their opinions and to value their actions, even if we don't agree with them. It also means that we respect each other's time and feelings when working together. Respecting the environment means to think about the impact our actions have on the environment as a whole including on animals and plants.
    - You respect others’ differences (culture, religion, mindset…) and opinions (active listening, understand before commenting/criticizing…)
    - You respect others’ time: Respect your commitments, prepare your meetings, Join a meeting only if you’re bringing value...
    - You criticise actions, not people: Provide your sincere feedback in the only goal to improve your colleague and the work in Tiramisu
    - You respect the environment and the planet: Before engaging with partners, launching a feature/service or in your daily life, let’s ask “what is the impact on the planet?”


-   **Openness**: Openness means taking down the barriers that constrain communication, decision making, collaboration, and ideas sharing. By being more open, we can strengthen the relationships within communities and build bridges to facilitate the exchange between cultures.
    - You are open for new ideas
    - You constantly challenge the status quo
    - You actively seek to bring diverse perspectives to the table
    - You provide transparent and helpful feedback to your colleague. 
    - You are open for feedback from anyone, regardless of their status/position.

-   **Fun**: fIt is important to us that we as individuals have fun working together on the project, and that our users have fun engaging with our application. Having fun means to not take things too seriously, to able to laugh, share jokes, and build positive relationships. It is just as important that we celebrate our successes as it is that we learn from our failures.
    - You bring your positive energy to the meetings and to the work (it’s ok to feel down sometimes, if this happens, be open about it in the meeting’s check-in)
    - You don’t take things (except our values, purpose and objectives) seriously
    - You/We celebrate small and big wins

-   **Responsibility**: As a company and as individuals, we are responsible for our actions. Being responsible means that we ensure that our actions do not harm, or in any other way negatively impact, our teammates, our communities, our partners, and our planet.
    - You are responsible, at the same level as everyone else, for the success or failure of the project
    - You define your objectives (inline with the company’s objectives) and you are responsible for achieving them
    - You are responsible for your actions: You admit mistakes freely and openly
    - You will not shy away from the difficult conversations (provide feedback, openly discuss issues)
    - You question decisions and actions that are not inline with our values or derailing us from reaching our objectives
