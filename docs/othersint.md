*From Euforia*

-   Make sure that you tell the person about this evaluation at the beginning of his/her journey! :-)

-   Just send him/her the document and ask to fill it in *well in advance* (10 days) before the meeting so that the people involved in the evaluation can fill it in too (normally these are the integration coach and the lead link of the circle where the newbee works).

-   Once the evaluators have filled in the document (3-4 days before the meeting) remind the newbee to read their inputs *before* the evaluation meeting. That lets the person digest the information in advance (especially in case of constructive feedback it is important for people to be able to think about it before the meeting takes place).

## The wholebeing Mix[]
---------------------------------------------

After the newbee has been confirmed in his/her roles after the end of trial period evaluation it is your task as in integration coach to explain our wholebeing mix universe :D You can ask them to read the Wholebeing Mix session. and then answer to any questions they might have.
